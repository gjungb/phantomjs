Get or set Cookies visible to the current URL (though, for setting, use of `page.addCookie` is preferred). This array will be pre-populated by any existing Cookie data visible to this URL that is stored in the CookieJar, if any.

## Examples

```javascript
var webPage = require('webpage');
var page = webPage.create();
// @TODO: Finish page.cookies example.
```
